<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Once upon a time there was a fine <sup>pigeon</sup> who used to live on a 
nest close to a kitchen. The cooks of the kitchen used to like her very much 
and often used to feed her grain. She liked the place and her life was 
fine.</p>
<h2>Crow meet Pigeon</h2>
<p>One day a <sup>crow</sup> saw the pigeon and saw how it was getting 
wonderful food from the kitchen. Then one day she made friendship with the 
pigeon, and under the pretext of friendship, she somehow made the pigeon to 
share the nest with the crow.</p>
<p>The pigeon then told her that they could spend time together discussing 
politics, religion etc but when it came to food both had their own ways.</p>
<p>So she suggested the crow to search for her own food.</p>
<h2>Impatient Crow</h2>
<p>But the crow was <sub>impatient</sub> and the very reason she had made 
friends with the pigeon was for the food. The crow wanted meat and all the 
pigeon got was grains from the kitchen. </p>
<p>It could not wait any longer and ultimately decided that <i>she visit the 
kitchen directly for the food</i>. </p>
<p>Thinking so, it stealthily crept down the chimney into the kitchen. She 
got the smell of a fish being curried on the pan. She got greedy and went 
ahead and tried to get the fish. But in the process she disturbed a ladle, 
and created a noise. This alerted the cook who was in the neighbouring room 
and he caught hold of the crow and killed it.</p>
